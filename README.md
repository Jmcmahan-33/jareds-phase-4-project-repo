# My Health App


## Description
My Health App is a web application designed to simplify the process of scheduling medical appointments and make it easier for users to manage their healthcare needs. Users can log in or sign up to request an appointment with a doctor from the shared list of doctor recommendations. Once requested, the user can update the appointment date or cancel the appointment. Each user can only see their own scheduled appointments and cannot see appointments scheduled by other users to ensure privacy and security of personal health information. With this feature, users can easily find a doctor that meets their specific needs and book appointments conveniently.
